## Supported Commands

### Invoking Blue Bus Companion

To start interacting with this service, open Google Assistant and say, "talk to blue bus companion," and Google Assistant will direct you to this service where you can start asking any of the questions listed below.

### Check Route Status

You can check whether a certain bus route is currently running by saying a phrase such as "Is Commuter North active?" or "Is Northwood currently running?" and Blue Bus Companion will respond with a yes/no answer.

### Get ETA of Bus

You can find how far the bus of a specific route is from your closest stop via phrases like "Where is the nearest Bursley Baits bus from me?" or "How far is Commuter South from here?" and, after receiving your consent to use your location, Blue Bus Companion will give you the number of minutes it will take for a bus of that route to arrive at the stop closest to you. For example, asking "When will Commuter North be here?" from South Quad will result in a response saying that Commuter North will arrive at the Law Quad stop in 7 minutes. In addition, a suggestion card will show up at the bottom of the screen allowing you to navigate to your closest stop in Google Maps if you are unsure where it is located.

## Problems & Suggestions

If you have any issues using Blue Bus Companion (such as it not recognizing a phrase or giving the wrong information) or you have any other suggestions, please file this in the GitHub issue tracker or shoot me an email at yerrak@umich.edu.
